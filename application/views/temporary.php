	<h3 class="emphasis">Manage every phase of the physical device lifecycle</h3>
	<p>If your organization contains a large number of desktops and notebooks, you may find it challenging to maintain control over all of your systems while giving your end users the tools they need to be productive.

	<p>However, desktop management doesn’t need to be complicated. Matrix42 makes it easy to manage every phase in the client lifecycle – from provisioning to retirement. With Matrix42, you can:</p>

					<h3 class="emphasis">Easily Manage the Entire Client Lifecycle - from OS Deployment to Retirement</h3>
					<p>Unlike other desktop management solutions, Matrix42 can manage the entire client lifecycle – from provisioning to retirement. Matrix42 simplifies every phase in this process by helping you:</p>
					<h4 class="emphasis">Increase the Speed of Your OS Deployments While Dramatically Reducing Errors</h4>
					<p>Matrix42 makes it easy for you to provision a bare-metal system – even if you’re working remotely. You won’t need to search for and install the right drivers for each system – a time-intensive task that could involve hundreds to thousands of configurations. During the OS deployment, Matrix42 will automatically find the correct drivers for each system. This eliminates guesswork, mistakes and downtime.</p>
					<h4 class="emphasis">Automate Your Software Discovery, Management and Reporting</h4>
					<p>Matrix42 automatically finds all of your IT assets – without installing a software agent that would change a system’s desired state. You can pre-schedule inventory scans or run them on demand to gain insight into your hardware and software. These scans will show you exactly what programs are installed, who is using them and the frequency of their use. This helps with your license management, as you can uninstall software that is not being used and reduce your licensee expenses.</p>
					<p>Plus, you can deploy software updates and patches while keeping your systems in their desired states. Simply set your test and approval preferences once and then forget about them – Matrix42’s software management tools will ensure they occur as planned and that your systems remain in compliance with corporate policies.</p>
					<h4 class="emphasis">Keep Your Data Secure Throughout the Entire Client Life Cycle</h4>
					<p>With Matrix42, your end users won’t lose their data during OS deployments and software updates. You can back up and restore all their data and settings with the push of a button – either from within the Matrix42 console or directly from the end user’s system.</p>
					<p>Matrix42 also ensures your systems are configured properly – which prevents security breaches, compliance issues and downtime.</p>
					<p>Finally, Matrix42 can completely wipe your retired systems. This ensures that your data doesn’t fall into the wrong hands if your hardware is sold, reassigned or junked.</p>

					<h3 class="emphasis">Streamline Your Desktop Management</h3>
					<p>Matrix42 Empirum Workplace Automation provides you with everything you need to automate your time-consuming desktop management tasks – for both physical and virtual desktops. It also integrates all of the processes in your client lifecycle management, from installation through secure data wiping, into one user-friendly platform.</p>
					<p>Here’s how the Empirum Workplace Automation modules can streamline your IT management:</p>
					<p><span class="bold">Inventory Management</span> gives you detailed data for every device connected to your corporate network, such as desktops, laptops, software, printers, routers, mobile devices and more. This allows you to learn what is in use, so you can remove unused applications, cancel unneeded licenses and reduce your IT costs.</p>
					<p><span class="bold">Software Management</span> automates all of your software deployments and updates – no matter how complex. It shows you exactly what is installed on each machine, so you can gain control of your software distributions and ensure your rollouts go smoothly. Thanks to Software Management’s user-friendly features, some of Matrix42’s customers have reduced their rollout failure rates from 10% to 0.002%.</p>
					<p><span class="bold">OS Deployment</span> automates your operating system deployments and migrations, which will reduce your errors, help desk calls and the amount of time you spend creating configurations for hardware. You can update your systems either on site or remotely with just one click.</p>
					<p><span class="bold">Personal Backup</span> restores all user data and settings with the push of a button – either remotely or directly from the end user’s system. This module can also restore all application, data and operating system settings during an OS migration.</p>
					<p><span class="bold">Easy Recovery</span> provides complete disaster recovery after a virus infection, hardware failure or fatal system error.</p>
					<p><span class="bold">Remote Control</span> lets you gain remote access to a user’s system in under 7 seconds – even if it’s protected by firewalls. This allows you to provide your end users with instant support upon request while saving the costs and hassles of travel.</p>
					<p>Matrix42 won IT-Administrator’s “Migration to Windows 7” benchmark test in 2010</p>
