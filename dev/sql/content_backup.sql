According to a Cisco study on the international workforce, 66% of employees &quot;expect IT to allow them to use any device â€“ personal or company-issued â€“ to access corporate networks, applications, and information anywhere at any time, and they expect the types of devices to continue diversifying.&quot;</p>\n	<p>This trend is due to the growing popularity of smartphones, tablets and social media - especially among young professionals. Your tech-savvy, young employees expect to use the same technology at work that they use in their personal lives. If you want to attract and retain talent, you must support the next generation&#39;s preferred work style and start a &quot;bring your own device&quot; (BYOD) program.</p>\n	<p>If you don&#39;t embrace BYOD, your employees will find a way to work around your policies and use their own mobile devices to access your network. This can result in breaches to your systems and hackers accessing your sensitive corporate data - especially if an employee&#39;s mobile device is lost or stolen. That&#39;s why your BYOD initiative must meet your employees&#39; needs while ensuring your company data is safe and compliant - without affecting the rest of your IT infrastructure.</p>\n	%%getstartedpage%%\n	<div id=\"product-tab-container\" class=\"well margin-right\">\n		<ul id=\"product-tab\" class=\"nav nav-tabs\" data-tabs=\"product-tab\">\n			<li class=\"active\"><a href=\"#benefits\" data-toggle=\"tab\">Benefits</a></li>\n			<li><a href=\"#keys\" data-toggle=\"tab\">3 Keys</a></li>\n			<li><a href=\"#features\" data-toggle=\"tab\">Features</a></li>\n		</ul><!-- product-tab -->\n		<div class=\"tab-container\">\n			<div class=\"tab-content\">\n				<div class=\"tab-pane active padded-content\" id=\"benefits\">\n					<h3 class=\"emphasis\">The Business Benefits of &quot;Bring Your Own Device&quot; (BYOD)</h3>\n					<p>The transition to BYOD is as much about processes as it is about technology. When you put the right systems in place to support BYOD, you will reduce your risks and achieve the following benefits:</p>\n					<ul class=\"list\">\n						<li><span class=\"bold emphasis\">Cost reductions.</span> <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=696007\" target=\"_blank\">Gartner reported</a> that organizations can see a 9% to 44% reduction in capital expenditures when they adopt BYOD. This is because BYOD is similar to giving employees car allowances instead of buying them company cars - they both allow you to provide employees with the tools they need while you save money. By allowing employees to use their own devices, you can greatly reduce the amount of hardware you must purchase and maintain.</li>\n						<li><span class=\"bold emphasis\">Increased employee satisfaction and productivity.</span> When you allow your employees to use their favorite mobile devices, they can accomplish more and respond to requests faster - whether they&#39;re working in the office or remotely. BYOD also shows your employees that you are willing to support their preferred work styles.</li>\n						<li><span class=\"bold emphasis\">Greater security across all of your devices.</span> Implementing a BYOD strategy allows you to secure all of your organization&#39;s mobile devices, avoid data loss and protect yourself from industrial spying and data theft.</li>\n					</ul>\n					<p>Matrix42 makes it easy for you to launch a BYOD program that meets the needs of both your employees and IT team. Your employees can use their favorite mobile devices to access your network, request support and receive services. Meanwhile, your IT department can maintain control over all of your organization&#39;s mobile devices, provide a higher level of service and reduce their costs.</p>\n				</div><!-- benefits -->\n				<div class=\"tab-pane padded-content\" id=\"keys\">\n					<h3 class=\"emphasis\">3 Keys to a Successful BYOD Program</h3>\n					<p>Matrix42 provides you with all the tools you need to start and manage your BYOD program. The key features of our BYOD services include:</p>\n					<h4 class=\"emphasis\">Analysis</h4>\n					<p>The first step in a successful BYOD program is analysis. Matrix42&#39;s Inventory Management and software usage monitoring tools will help you to analyze your end users&#39; work profiles. You&#39;ll learn which devices, apps and services they prefer, as well as which users are good candidates for BYOD.</p>\n					<h4 class=\"emphasis\">Virtual Desktop Management</h4>\n					<p>Desktop virtualization is a key part of BYOD because it allows you to isolate your corporate data and apps from your end users&#39; personal data and apps. Matrix42 partners with industry leaders, such as Citrix, who provide the virtualization technology.</p>\n					<p>We then automate the entire virtualization process â€“ including configuring the virtual desktops, delivering them to your end users&#39; mobile devices and managing them going forward. This high level of automation has allowed some of our clients to lower their virtual desktop infrastructure migration costs by up to 75%.</p>\n					<h4 class=\"emphasis\">End User Self-Service</h4>\n					<p>Offering self-service options is critical to your BYOD program&#39;s success. Through Matrix42 Service Catalog, your end users can shop for IT services from their mobile devices and receive automated support. For example, end users can request and install corporate apps directly from their personal mobile devices. This allows you to provide faster response times while you greatly reduce the effort you put into service delivery. Since all requests for service are automatically approved and provisioned, you can reduce your help desk calls by as much as 40%.</p>\n				</div><!-- keys -->\n				<div class=\"tab-pane padded-content\" id=\"features\">\n					<h3 class=\"emphasis\">Overcoming the Challenges of BYOD</h3>\n					<p>Many IT professionals view BYOD as more work and hassle. Your own IT department may be concerned about some of the common problems that can occur if a BYOD program is not properly planned, including security breaches and high costs. Matrix42 offers the following tools to help you overcome these problems:</p>\n					<h4 class=\"emphasis\">Advanced Security Features</h4>\n					<p>Matrix42 offers a number of features to help you maintain a secure environment and control over your company assets and data. For example, Mobile Device Management provides you with the following security features, so you don&#39;t have to worry about mobile device theft or data loss.</p>\n					<ul class=\"list\">\n						<li><span class=\"bold emphasis\">Remote Management.</span> When Matrix42 detects a non-compliant device, it will instantly disable access to your corporate data and services. If a mobile device is lost, stolen or non-compliant, Matrix42 can remotely lock or wipe it of all corporate data to prevent information theft.</li>\n						<li><span class=\"bold emphasis\">Automated back-up features</span> help you avoid critical data loss.</li>\n						<li><span class=\"bold emphasis\">A mobile email gateway</span> that tracks every device interaction and allows only authorized devices to access your email server. It will also warn you of threats.</li>\n					</ul>\n					<h4 class=\"emphasis\">Cost Control Tools</h4>\n					<p>Although you need to make an investment when you adopt the desktop virtualization technology that is needed for BYOD, the long-term value far outweighs the upfront costs. Matrix42 can help you achieve the following benefits from desktop virtualization:</p>\n					<ul class=\"list\">\n						<li><span class=\"bold emphasis\">Up to a 60% reduction in your IT management costs</span> thanks to automated installations and updates.</li>\n						<li><span class=\"bold emphasis\">Easy desktop management.</span> Matrix42 allows you to manage all of your physical and virtual devices from just 1 flexible console. This can reduce the total cost of ownership of your virtual devices by up to 45%.</li>\n						<li><span class=\"bold emphasis\">Automated license compliance,</span> which can help you avoid costly audits and lower your software licenses expenses by up to 23%.</li>\n					</ul>\n				</div><!-- features -->\n			</div><!-- tab-content -->\n		</div><!-- tab-content -->\n	</div><!-- product-tab-container -->\n</div><!-- padded -->',NULL),

This eliminates guesswork, mistakes and downtime.</p>\n					<h4 class=\"emphasis\">Automate Your Software Discovery, Management and Reporting</h4>\n					<p>Matrix42 automatically finds all of your IT assets - without installing a software agent that would change a system\'s desired state. You can pre-schedule inventory scans or run them on demand to gain insight into your hardware and software. These scans will show you exactly what programs are installed, who is using them and the frequency of their use. This helps with your license management, as you can uninstall software that is not being used and reduce your licensee expenses.</p>\n					<p>Plus, you can deploy software updates and patches while keeping your systems in their desired states. Simply set your test and approval preferences once and then forget about them - Matrix42\'s software management tools will ensure they occur as planned and that your systems remain in compliance with corporate policies.</p>\n					<h4 class=\"emphasis\">Keep Your Data Secure Throughout the Entire Client Life Cycle</h4>\n					<p>With Matrix42, your end users won\'t lose their data during OS deployments and software updates.
